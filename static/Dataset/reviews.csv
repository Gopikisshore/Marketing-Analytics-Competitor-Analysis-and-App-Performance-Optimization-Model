I dedicated so much time and even sacrifice my sleep to complete a very long course and the app started malfunctioning and my progress wasn't saved.

420,"I was so excited to find this app. I've always wanted to learn about a lot of different subjects and now I can/am! Some of the ancient history time line is a little off, it's based around the Christianity/religious timeline. (Which I thought was super lame.) I was super impressed with how much education app has to offer. It's not all just boring, having to read 50 pages in order to finish one section of a section. You go by your own pace of course. Highly recommend.",5,21,2022-11-07 01:20:14,org.khanacademy.android
421,Excellent easy to follow and understand. I've been out of school for 30 years and needed to relearn/refresh my memory to help my middle school son and this worked wonders. I was an expert in literally 20 minutes after 5 videos. Took a 4 question quiz after and got a perfect score.,5,53,2022-09-04 06:49:51,org.khanacademy.android
422,"It's great. I am using it to brush up on Grammer for my field of work but I found much more. Upon exploration, I found useful learning concepts for both my children and myself in mathematics, history, science, arts and humanities. After going through a few videos, I see that they focus on multiple learning styles. Each video has traits of visual, read/wright, and auditory. After the video, they provide quizzes for hands on. It's an amazing resource for anyone wanting to learn.",5,10,2019-03-30 07:55:53,org.khanacademy.android
423,"For the platform itself, 11/10. The fact that such an amazing website exists that is completely free with no subscription ever, is absolutely incredible. For the app, I find it somewhat difficult to find and access profile settings but that's probably on me, and I kind of prefer the previous app layout. I love being able to learn subjects I would otherwise never have access to, and I would love to see language courses incorporated eventually! Great job all around. Have been using for years!",5,279,2020-04-20 05:36:27,org.khanacademy.android
424,"This is a great educational app! I do three of my school subjects on this, and it makes learning easy. They have great informational videos, and quizzes to apply what you've learned. I also think the app layout is great as well. The ability to pin courses is really nice. One thing I wish they would have kept was the jump to the ""up next for you"" lesson/task button that would allow me to get to my course material faster without having to scroll through all of it. Regardless, still a great app!",5,385,2020-04-06 21:41:12,org.khanacademy.android
425,"Great app of course, this is free education so I can't complain about that. The computer version is much better and easier to navigate however. I have a lot of difficulty entering answers into the quiz on the mobile version for Algebra. So I find myself redoing problems to try and get a better score. So if you have access to a computer I think you'd get more out of the course but nonetheless this is a good app overall.",5,35,2021-04-09 18:07:32,org.khanacademy.android
426,"This app has helped me quite a bit. I feel like I can stay on track and have a free tutor outside of my college classes and refresh what I forgot in highschool. The English and grammar lessons are easy to remember and well built, and although the math lectures can be slow, they make it easy to understand the material and focus on harder concepts one at a time. You can work on the go without having to have a computer standing by, or at a PC at home. Perfect for my needs!",5,135,2020-04-12 19:56:23,org.khanacademy.android
427,"Tried deleting and reinstalling. I'm on an up to date Samsung Galaxy s8 plus. Tried restarting my phone. Still doesn't work. The website works fine, I know I like that. Update: Contacted the help desk. In less than 24 hours, they looked into it and made an update. It works perfectly now. Prompt attention and correction to the problem.",5,136,2018-12-21 06:49:37,org.khanacademy.android
428,"Very convenient for math (or any subject) on concepts you have trouble with, but I do wish that I could work out problems without having the need to physically write things down (I just solve problems in my head). If you could add a notes tab on quizzes (where you can tap/slide from the side of your screen to bring it over if you want to use it to type notes down, and to tap/slide it back to to the side of the screen to consume less screen space), this app would be even better :D",5,133,2019-12-18 08:32:48,org.khanacademy.android
429,So easy to navigate and the courses offered seem endless! The structure of the courses I've started is very similar to the college courses I've taken and I can do them at my own pace! The political science class I'm taking right now is debatably better than the calsses I took at the University! The instructor does a great job at simplifying and expanding in areas that seem confusing.,5,346,2020-10-22 21:09:44,org.khanacademy.android
430,"I absolutely recommend this app. I had teachers before that couldn't explain things well and I always stayed up studying with Khan Academy. They're very through with subjects and give the best demonstrations on how to do things. it's awesome for both visual and auditory learners. It also has a lot of languages and a very neat and organized setting. You can just download this app, search up what you need and you're good to go! I have definitely aced a few test thanks to Khan Academy. Bless Y'all.",5,28,2019-07-03 14:27:51,org.khanacademy.android
431,"Love the app, no complaints whatsoever. I do have a suggestion though. The youtube app has a pop out video feature that allows the users to browse other apps or parts of their phone while the video/audio still plays. Would it be possible for the Khan Team to program a feature like this into the app? I think it would greatly enhance the user experience for the app. Thank you for your time!",5,23,2019-12-02 03:24:04,org.khanacademy.android
432,"This app is phenomenal! They have a wide variety of subjects, teachers who are truly enthusiastic about the subject they teach as well as encouraging, practice quizzes, tests, and a clear outline of what to expect in each course. Some subjects I study to learn; others I study to brush up on and the structure of Khan Academy allows me to do both easily. I have downloaded many educational apps over the years and this is by far the best. I HIGHLY recommend!",5,347,2021-08-12 05:02:36,org.khanacademy.android
433,"Absolutely brilliant! I've been struggling in math, and find this app to be extremely helpful; everything is explained in a way that I can actually understand. Only downside: none of the practice tests seem to work, error occurs everytime. I've tried uninstalling/installing. Edit: The issue had been corrected.",5,59,2018-12-25 09:45:15,org.khanacademy.android
434,"I am a home school parent who LOVES the courses offered at Khan Academy and I can easily incorporate it into my curriculum on Google Classroom. My only issue is that when I try to use my tablet, the app seems to have me as a student , and I am not able to pull up the courses to check work turned in or assign new work.

609,The service looks good.  I haven't watch classes yet but they look like they will be good though.  However that app has one glaring flaw that is inexcusable in 2019 that makes the app itself 1 star automatically in my book.  You can not download videos to your SD card. At least I can't find a way to do it.  So you have to fill the device storage up with videos if you want to download them for offline viewing.  Making that feature pretty much unusable unless you have a basically empty phone as even a 36 min class is over half a gig.  Which is not surprising since HD videos are large files.  Which is why with competently made video apps you can download them to the SD card instead of the device storage.  If you could download the classes to the SD card it would be a 5 star app as the rest works well and is simple to use.,1,4,2019-02-27 23:12:05,com.skillshare.Skillshare

870,"I recently subscribed to LinkedIn Learning/Lynda and I am very much impressed overall with the service, both on the web version and the mobile versions of the apps. I have been able to find courses on everything I am looking for and there are usually a few instructors for each topic. One might think this is a terrible thing because of potentially repetitive information, but by simply watching the different instructors, you may find someone who makes you feel most comfortable which is most important in any learning experience. This is a fantastic service to support experts who are willing to take the time out to teach and enrich those who are willing to learn. Thank you for the service!",5,39,2018-10-24 16:09:58,com.linkedin.android.learning

874,Don't want to give full 5 but better than 4. I like it has a lot of tech stuff I want and have added other important life lessons that can help anyone. What I think takes away a full 5 stars is they need to add an attribute to videos if the video can be only listened to as in it does not have nesscary visual information. This way you can search for them.

1024,I personally loved the platform. But the app has some limitations and it's okay to have that. Coursera courses are really organised. It's been couple of months I'm on it and my experience is excellent. Very well described. And difficulty level increases with intermidiate level and then advanced level courses. It's a really good platform for knowledge and also promotions.,5,15,2022-10-13 02:17:25,org.coursera.android
1025,"Coursera is amazing. I think the write ups could do better in terms of grammatical and spelling errors, but it helps you learn despite where you are starting from in easy and fun ways.

I can't fast forward the video by double tapping anymore. Speeding up the video requires a few steps instead of one like how it was done. The video constantly buffers which almost never happened in the previous version! I hope this 'downgraded' upgrade is temporary and the useful features can be restored.

1050,"New interface is atrocious. Everything was smooth, and easy to understand. Now everything is stretched out too much, and nothing is labeled. They also reduced lesson ""experience"" across the board in their ranked system to encourage people to buy their ""Super"" option (do not, it is not worth it). Probably going to switch to another place to learn if this change is not reverted. It really is impossible to navigate now, and not a user friendly update.",1,315,2022-11-16 11:23:14,com.duolingo
1051,"Not a fan of the new layout at all. This is truly a case of fixing something that wasn't broken. Previously, I could focus on specific topics, jump around, and got a good variety of content. The old interface felt considerably more engaging, while the new single track UI makes the lessons feel more forced. Unfortunate that they couldn't offer both UI options. I'm likely going to look at some of the competing apps at this point.",1,47,2022-11-15 08:05:58,com.duolingo
1052,Ruined by an update. I really enjoyed the sense of control and feedback I got from the old UI. It let me choose what subject to practice and showed specific progress. Now everything looks the same and I have no choice what I practice. I can't focus on areas I know I'm lacking and there's no sense of progress and accomplishment. I made it a goal to get all lessons to level 3 in my unit before starting the next one but now those milestones don't even exist.,1,210,2022-11-15 09:24:53,com.duolingo
1053,I really liked Duo setup. But then they forced a really horrible update. It finished things I hadn't done. And rather than having alot of freedom to work on what I felt like changed to a system with very little choice. It's horrific. I ve had it for a couple years but will be cancelling as soon as my annual subscription is used up. Please have an option to go back to the old way.,1,462,2022-11-02 10:51:44,com.duolingo
1054,I used to like Duolingo. Then they changed the app format and now it sucks. I wish they'd give you the option to revert back to it. I had made so much progress on it and when they made the switch it erased so much of my progress. I liked that we could go back and do a little review to refresh your memory on units that had already been mastered. I have had the app for about a year and a half. I will be deleting this and find a different app to learn french on that isn't as frustrating.,1,842,2022-11-12 08:57:04,com.duolingo
1055,"The new update with a ""path"" style is an absolute disaster and a horrible interface. You have sections like ""introduce yourself"" but exercises for ordering food. Doesn't make a d‚òÜmn bit of sense. You have to click on each button to see what the heck the lesson is, and some of the buttons don't even do anything. I'm switching to any other app with a better UI. This one was the best and now it's probably the worst. Canceling my subscription, do not recommend this app.",1,401,2022-11-03 01:11:37,com.duolingo
1056,The app was great until the recent overhaul. They had a nice system that let you review up to 3 lessons that needed practice without using up mistakes and an easy way for someone like me to customize my learning experience. Now it's all streamlined into a one size fits all model that no longer helps me. I've had the app for years but I think it's time to let it go since it isn't helpful for every free user anymore.,1,2,2022-11-17 10:02:23,com.duolingo
1057,"Since the app automatically updated itself to the new ""learning path"" it's no longer fun. I had a system with the old layout, repairing the cracked lessons, doing the fun little stories, etc. Now it's no fun and I think I want to cancel my paid subscription. Please give us the option to go back to the original learning layout, this one is horrible and changed for the worse. I used to genuinely love opening the app every day.",1,164,2022-11-13 18:02:18,com.duolingo
1058,"Used to love the app. There are annoying apps and lots of ways to spend money to make it 'easier' but overall I felt like I was learning. Now that they have updated the software I don't feel as though I can review the basics as easily as I could before making them not stick and the new layout is too spread out. It makes it chaotic, making me consider taking my business elsewhere. I wish we at least had an option to condense it down as well as chose the old layout with the broken egg challenges.",1,65,2022-11-15 11:37:07,com.duolingo
1059,"I've put up with a lot over the years from Duolingo, even bending over background to turn off their annoying cartoon characters and animations whenever possible, but with the new update I'm just done. It doesn't make language learning easy or fun whatsoever anymore, and has completely changed the way progress is presented so that I no longer have any idea where I am in my course. I'm giving up after nearly 10 years of learning and a (current) 1200+ day streak. Just not worth continuing.",1,43,2022-11-16 10:17:07,com.duolingo
1060,"It's so frustrating with the new remapped course. I doesn't fully save your progress and now you have to do the stories which was something I barely did before and now I have to it. I also like being able to back to pass lessons doing a little lesson and getting rid of the crack but now there's eight and when you finish those eight review lessons, it doesn't come back. I'm very sad and disappointed Duolingo didn't allow something so we could keep the old format. Hopefully they change it back.",1,39,2022-11-16 09:06:54,com.duolingo
1061,"The new UI / learning path leaves very little room for flexibility. It used to be you could choose to work on more than one conversation topic at a time, but now you have to master the highest level before getting to work on another, which is much more monotonous. It's also a lot more difficult now to find & practice previous lessons. You have to scroll for ages to find the earlier lessons. Very disappointing.",1,254,2022-11-09 09:23:45,com.duolingo
1062,It's awful.  1. Their grammar tips were an excellent feature and are now basically gone. You'll have better luck with a verbose 80s grammar book. 2. Going back to review lessons? You can't do that now. Why would they eliminate a helpful feature like that? The ability to review previous lessons is a key feature in language learning....and it makes me think someone is pulling an Elon and destroying the app on purpose. 3. I loved doing this every day. Now? Never again.,1,4,2022-11-17 12:12:35,com.duolingo
1063,"Not sure what you folks were thinking with this latest update. You removed the ability to study and focus on individual topics. Now, whatever the next lesson is that we're forced into, it is so broad that we're being taught too many words too infrequently. Let's not forget how visually redundant and endless the path through our language course now looks. This app did make learning a foreign language easier and more fun than I ever imagined. But then you changed that. I canceled my subscription.",1,675,2022-11-12 07:54:18,com.duolingo
1064,"I really loved Duolingo because it gave me a way to better connect with my grandfather. Although the new update's difficulty of the lessons severely lowered and I feel like I'm not being challenged anymore. I've been using the past few days to do try and catch up with my old skill tree. I hardly feel any motivation anymore. I think the new update can be good. However, let the users who prefer the old layout be able to switch back.",1,157,2022-11-07 02:36:08,com.duolingo

1066,"This was a great app but the new layout is terrible. I can't even find the point I had reached so have to start at random points. Also only 5 points per lesson instead of 20. Note to devs: New design is terrible, please change back to old design",1,0,2022-11-18 18:46:38,com.duolingo

1159,Used to be a huge fan. 1100+ day streak. One update last year started timing how long each lesson takes. For whatever reason that totally destroyed my motivation to use the app by adding unnecessary time stress.,4,1,2022-11-18 17:22:15,com.duolingo

1161,"I agree with the other comments that with the latest update, the stories became lost between lessons and there's now way more scrolling. Also previously, the tips were better - they would actually explain grammar rather than just show phrases from the lessons.

1170,"Better than a phrase book! I'm not sure if I will get fluency just from Duolingo, but I've already learned a solid base vocabulary, basic phrases, and some basic grammar. The app interface is good, and they've recently made changes to improve it, which hopefully they continue to do. The ads aren't bad, and the hearts system they use instead of a timer is a real nice feature, but you lose ads and get unlimited health if you go premium, which helps if you're looking to learn.",5,105,2022-10-29 09:42:06,com.duolingo
1171,"There's pros and cons to the new update. I like that the courses feel more like a journey. I also appreciate having an expanded view to see the tasks I've accomplished and having short stories added to core lessons. The cons are its not as quick going back and forth between lessons. Especially if you're farther along and want to look back, there's a lot of scrolling. Overall I'm happy with the change. It's good to try new things and not stay stagnant.

1172,"Great tool to informally learn a language I'm your spare moments. There is no substitute for actual conversation in a new language, but Duolingo is a fun and effective way to get the formal ""classroom"" aspects of the language rules and vocabulary. The lessons are well designed, the app has good incentives to keep you motivated. The ads are tolerable to a point.

1173,"Don't bother paying for Plus - offline doesn't work. I am using Duolingo to study Spanish and Korean. I definitely like the Spanish one better because I think there is more content and it has gone through more rounds to make it better for Spanish learners.  However, Plus drives me crazy.  I purchased it so that I could study offline since I study on my commute and a good portion of it is underground with spotty signal.  I can complete the lessons, but it doesn't save my progress.  This results in me having to do the same lessons over again and sometimes, losing my streak (heartbreaking!) I've complained to Duolingo about this and here is the response I got:  ""Our team is aware of this and is working diligently to fix it as quickly as possible. If you're ever in a pinch and you lose your streak because of offline issues, don't hesitate to reach out and we will update your streak right away. In the meantime, I suggest making sure that once you do connect to wifi, that it's a super strong connection. If you're on a weaker connection, it might need some extra time to update.""

1175,"I have been using Duolingo for years and it has absolutely made learning a language fun and easy. The lessons are short enough that just a few rounds of basic practice translates into useful conversational language. That being said, this new update on 11/15/22 absolutely sucks and I completely hate it.

1181,Exceptional app! If I could give it more stars I would. This app is very well thought out and the strategies for enabling self taught language acquisition through this app feel natural and allow me to control the degree of assistance I need. Extremely user friendly and fun. Notifications keep you motivated and ads keep it free. Ads are brief and offer rewards that are used to maintain your learning streaks.

1182,"Its amazing but you should add widgets! Definately one that shows the leaderboard and then maybe one with words of the language that show the other definition and it changes every 3-5 seconds to another word. That would be super cool!

Say you tap ""Home 2"" then there will be a vocabulary button and when you tap it, it shows all the words youve learned so far in ""Home 2"" as well as their English meaning!",5,2,2022-11-11 20:49:40,com.duolingo

1322,This is one of the best app to study. We have so many boards to select in this app. According to me by comparing with my textbook it is very similar and for me it is easy to study in topper. It is very useful for me at my preparation time. All the concepts are clearly explained in topper with visuals. Visualisation is very important to study and we remember it for a long time. That's what did by the topper. So thanks topper.,5,11,2022-09-20 07:08:42,haygot.togyah.app

1592,"First of all, I must give my gratitude to the Developers of this app. My child loves it and is learning lots from it. And the Super Simple Songs integrated with the games are really great. But the app tends to have some seriously glitchy behaviours. It often shuts off in mid-game and takes the user to the phone home screen. It freezes at that point for some time with a black screen and when trying to getting back into it, it resets the game so my child loses where the game left off. It's a real test of patience at that age. I have had to restart my phone in order to get it to work again sometimes. On another note, certain things that are required to be either clicked or dragged are placed way to close to the top of the screen, which oftentimes causes my child to activate the slide-in menu from the phone during some games. Also a minor thing, when there's a song involved, there are moments where the song is paused in order to begin an interactive game. But the songs are often paused on odd times. It's really not so crucial but it triggers my OCD to some degree. I would suggest to try to tackle that with a little more finesse :) I realize it's in beta but I hope they pay attention to these things when the time comes to launch the real thing.

1602,My grand daughter is at kindergarten level and loves it. Sort of getting addicted. Thank you so much for making it free and without commercials. There are couple of issues that we experienced... The sound it makes when not done correctly is very startling to her and she is afraid to make mistakes. She is not learning how to read yet she is asked to do crossword puzzles. How is it possible? Sometimes directions are not clear or pictures are too small to make out. Thank you n God Bless.üôèüëçüôè,4,73,2020-08-16 04:17:36,org.khankids.android

Cons: 1) Often we have to restart to use the app. Don't know if this is a problem on the Chromebook side or KAK app side. 2) As a teacher, it is frustrating to have to use the app to assign activities.

1621,"Best learning app for children I've found!! My children love it! We love all the books! The kids love being able to choose content from the ""library."" The learning path is creatively designed. (: The kids love the ""gifts""! (: I'm happy we can turn the music off - some apps don't let you mute the music, which can become distracting when trying to learn. The interface is very intuitive! The best part - it's free! My only wish would be for the learning path difficulty to be more customizable. (:",5,135,2022-08-23 09:24:54,org.khankids.android
1622,This is a go to app for my kids. One of the few apps I don't have to monitor because of content and/or ads. It keeps them interested They learn plenty all while having fun. My absolute favorite thing about this app is how I can set up can set up Separate accounts for everyones Individual needs in age. Setup is clear and easy and I'm able to set up and move through it with ease.,5,229,2022-06-16 21:42:24,org.khankids.android
1623,"It starts a little slow, but give it at least ten lessons before you give up. Also, I realized you can pick whatever lesson you want from the Library icon in the upper left of the home screen. It feels like being in a kids' tv show and getting to answer questions along the way. The animal characters are cute and friendly. I used it for several hours, and it seems completely ad-free, which is great.",5,76,2022-08-10 05:42:24,org.khankids.android
1624,"This app is great, really engaging for my 4 year old preschooler. She loves that she can do it on her own, without any help from me. There's a good mix of activities, songs, and stories, and it goes over so much curriculum like letters, numbers, colors, comparisons, phonics, etc. Really phenomenal for any app, much less a free one. Highly recommend!",5,80,2022-05-25 19:55:05,org.khankids.android
1625,"So far so good. We've only had the app for a few weeks and my three year old is very intrigued. She loves the library section because she likes to pick her own books. She can also navigate the app very well by herself (big plus). No ads (bigger plus), I can safely leave it in her hands. I like the quick learning segments. It is a fun way to learn for a few minutes or longer quiet times.",5,63,2022-06-01 19:34:19,org.khankids.android
1626,"My kids (ages 3 and 5) thoroughly enjoy this app.  The activities are varied enough to keep them interested but repetitive enough to give them a sense of mastery and success.  My 5-year-old can navigate his way through the app without our intervention because of the intuitive interface and helpful audible** prompts.  (**Unfortunately, because my kids still can't read, we can't use this app in situations where the device has to remain very quiet/muted... too often, the non-text-based visual cues/instructions don't sufficiently explain the task at hand.)  It's a valuable resource for our family.  Thanks Khan Academy!!",5,6,2019-03-07 01:48:34,org.khankids.android
1627,"Love this app!! I've spent so much time downloading, trying out, and deleting apps while searching for something appropriate for my toddler to use. I'm impressed and love that it's geared towards learning, as opposed to just mindless play. It has so many different important, and in my opinion, usually untouched (by other apps,) subjects and lessons. It seems that most apps for kids 5 and under only include shapes, colors, or letters and numbers, which is nice, but my child has those mastered already, so I was thrilled to see the range of learning topics covered. Between the content, the lack of ads, easy navigation, I'd say Great job! Keep it up! I'll definitely be recommending this app!",5,2,2018-10-03 12:55:55,org.khankids.android
1628,"I love Khan Academy and their mission of free, quality education. As a frequent user of it over the years, I was excited, but hesitant to see their app for children. Most other education apps geared toward children are filled with ads or are limited/extremely basic unless you pay. Khan Academy contains none of that. It's filled with fun, interesting games that are age appropriate. My daughter loves the songs and activities. I like that you can select different levels based on their age, and it's easy enough for her to navigate (she's two, almost three) while my hands are busy doing her hair. Thank you, Khan Academy!",5,18,2018-11-27 19:50:21,org.khankids.android
1629,My daughter's almost 18 months but she's obsessed with phones and she will hand them to us when the screen is off to turn it back on. All I really wanted for now was an app she could use where I wouldn't have to worry about her sending messages/changing settings etc. but I figured I'd try to also find one she could actually use properly once she's a bit older.  I tried a few of the most popular ones and wasn't too impressed. The Khan one is so much better and she's clearly already learning from it and trying really hard to understand what's going on to use it properly. I don't think it will be long before that happens.  I love the wide range of different content on there and it all feels like useful stuff for her to learn about. The music and voices and animations are all great and not annoying like many kids' things can be. We will be getting her a tablet for her 2nd birthday and this is probably the only app it'll have on it.,5,8,2019-05-23 20:49:31,org.khankids.android
1630,"I downloaded this for my 2 and 4 year olds. They love it! There is so much variety and I never have to buy a new pack of something or tell my kids they can only play on certain unlocked parts because it's all free! My kids love being able to switch between listening to books, watching videos, and playing games. I love that it's all educational, can be tailored to each child's age/level, and that you can link the account to different devices by via login and they can be at the same spot on all devices! Great app!",5,14,2018-10-24 18:24:08,org.khankids.android
1631,"Familiar with Kahn academy in my own schooling, I had an expected a high caliber of effort and effectiveness and overall quality. This app exceeded my expectations. My daughter(2) gets lost in the songs and books. She has learned multiple tunes and words while I do the dishes, drive the car, or shop for dinner. Obviously it isn't a replacement for working with your kiddo but it's MUCH better than the apps that trick her into buying things or letting her run wild in the matrix of YouTube. The only problem I've experienced: sometimes the loading screen gets stuck for minutes. Being in Beta this is highly understandable. She brings it to me and I close the app and she restarts. Overall an amazing app. I'm eagerly anticipating each update and highly appreciative of the most recent one :)",5,13,2018-12-12 20:04:22,org.khankids.android
1632,"My 3 year old daughter and I both love this app. It has adorable characters, just the right mix of songs/games/interactive features, great learning content, and it lets the kid choose a game over and over again, which is what kids at this age love to do :)   My only complaint is with switching to other apps. I don't see the home/back/menu buttons while in the app (I use a Huawei Honor 7x), so I have to press the power button to get out of the app. And when I switch back, the app restarts, not allowing the kid to continue what she was playing.",5,13,2019-03-13 20:23:46,org.khankids.android
1633,"Great educational app. Started with my 2 year old. The content is advancing as he is learning more and is able to do more.  I love how it teaches more than just letters/reading and math - it teaches about weather and feelings, and even more. We are able to incorporate things from the app into our discussions of every day life, which helps him make connections more easily. And no ads or paid stuff! Perfect for a little kid who likes to tap everything to see what happens!",5,5,2019-03-07 02:29:14,org.khankids.android
1634,"I am so grateful for this app. My two year old daughter loves it. She is speech delayed and loves to learn and this is my favorite app for her. The only issue I have is the tapping and dragging feature is a bit difficult for her at with her age & capabilities. She taps the screen several times and it won't work and by the time it registers she's tapping again and it's undoing it and saying ""uh-oh"" so she is thinking she chose wrong. This gets her frustrated so we end up moving to another lesson.",5,8,2019-05-24 13:54:52,org.khankids.android

2288,"Can't say I'm thrilled with the app. Yes, it allows you to access your Great Courses stuff (the primary function is fine). It does not allow for screen rotation, so video presentation is limited to whatever the width (not length) of your screen is. It has an option for audio only, so you can cut back cell data usage while you're just listening. While using cell data, it also unexpectedly pauses, skips, and decides that you're done with a lecture while there are still several minutes to go. I haven't noticed this with WiFi data, but also haven't given it a thorough testing. Probably the second-most annoying part is that the app wants to launch every time I unlock my phone. I have absolutely no idea why. TL;DR? Sure you're going to be able to get your Great Courses stuff. Aside from that, it needs a lot of work.

All in all, there's a lot that feels poorly thought out and woefully executed. The inability to play content offline is absurd.

Any touch of the screen meant to get the buttons to show again may make you lose your progress on the lecture, and that's about as disruptive as it gets for this kind of app.",2,21,2019-06-05 11:09:52,com.tgc.greatcoursesplus

Now the new version, I'll admit, is certainly more aesthetically appealing. Being able to collapse different course titles in the ""Downloads"" view is helpful, and I like having quick access to the PDF course guides. However, this version also took a few steps backwards: 1) Why can't we store videos on SD card anymore? Will TGC bring that back or has it been permanently removed? The videos take up a LOT of space and I was running low as it was. 2) Now all videos play with the status bar and button bar permanently visible instead of in full-screen view. Could you please at least provide a setting so users can choose whether they want full-screen or non-full-screen playback? 3) Whenever I'm downloading a video for offline playback all the images on the screen start flashing.

2313,"2020-04-16 (revised to 3 stars) The folks at Great Courses Plus are obviously working on improving the user experience and have made a significant progress over the past 2 weeks. The latest version of the app (version 5.2) times out less frequently and hasn't crashed on me yet. Therefore, the original 1 star review is no longer warranted. There is still room for improvement, but kudos to TGC for the progress so far. 2020-04-04 (original review) The 1-star review is for the new release of the Android app and the lack of support for it. First general problems: The app hangs, crashes, and will go into spinner mode until you exit and restart it. This happens multiple times daily. And when it's not doing those things, it can be painfully slow. I suspect much of the slowness is due to a new back-end system implemented by the Great Courses. Things have gotten substantially worse after the upgrade to the new system (when all of the device passwords were reset). Specific bugs: 1) Speaking of passwords, the Android app has a 20 character limit for the password, even though the website will allow you to configure a longer password. There's no warning about this website. I had to figure it out the hard way. 2) The app allows you to download content so you don't have to stream and incur data plan charges. But inexplicably (I think because they never tested this), when you start to play downloaded content while not connected to wi-fi, you get a pop-up warning you that you need to change settings to allow data streaming because you're not connected to wi-fi. But this is the whole point of downloading content. And if you try to exit popup, you have either changed the setting (which I don't want to do - I downloaded the content because I *don't* want to stream over my data plan) or you haven't changed it and playback stops. So I just leave the dialog open and then app eventually crashes once I'm back in wi-fi range. Great... I haven't received a response to any of my recent attempts to contact Customer Service. As a long-time customer of The Teaching Company / The Great Courses (since the time when courses were sent out on cassette tapes) this is disappointing. They used to have very good, responsive customer service. It's a shame because the app and customer service are so bad that I'm ready to cancel.",3,39,2020-04-17 09:12:53,com.tgc.greatcoursesplus

My only issue is I wish the size of the closed captions was adjustable. It is so teeny tiny on my S9 that it's pointless to try to use them. I don't really use this app as much as I would like because of this. I have a slight auditory processing issue and watching things with captions is very helpful for me.,4,10,2019-07-08 13:13:54,com.tgc.greatcoursesplus
2343,Update: I added a star. The app is no longer struggling to load and play audio and video. Previous: The app itself is nice. But it really seems to struggle with audio and network interruptions - phone and sms. I've had to go as far as force stopping and purging local content to get it running normally again. It's unfortunate because it makes the product hard to enjoy.,4,77,2020-12-14 22:40:15,com.tgc.greatcoursesplus
2344,"Best new feature: you can now download lectures in audio and listen offline. (Before, you could only download video lectures.) The app now marks your place in each lecture, even if you skip between lectures or courses. It now freezes much less often. If it gets wonky or slow, try restarting your phone. If you need to pause for more than a few minutes, quit the app and restart it when you're back. If you press play after pausing too long, it drops you at a random point in an earlier lecture.",4,161,2020-09-19 02:47:11,com.tgc.greatcoursesplus
2345,"The updated app includes the ability to download audio versions of each lecture, plus the associated guidebook. These are terrific improvements over the former version.

2346,"The app used to be pretty bad and had a difficult to use UI. Also couldn't delete individual downloaded lectures, you had to delete a whole course of downloaded lectures. All these issues are now gone and the app runs much more smoothly now after an update that came out a late last year. Only thing I can think of that needs to change is making all lectures available for audio download, as I think there are still some that are available for video download only.",4,36,2020-06-20 02:53:28,com.tgc.greatcoursesplus

After I missed the first quarter of the lesson. Not a good first impression. And the only support option I saw was an ai bot. Oh and God forbid you get a phone call during the session.

2701,Not only do you pay a monthly subscription fee but you pay for class materials as well it is quite a racket they have going. On top of that you are inundated with messages through email and text about EVERYTHING!!!! I easily got at 6 - 7 emails and another 6 -7 texts each and every single day. Plus the app set notifications as well. The information in the classes were just not worth the hassle.,1,7,2020-09-04 02:22:18,com.shawacademy.app

I attempted to cancel 3 days into the free trial, it took a survey, multiple questions, and still was directed to call in.

2703,"Very misleading. Was very interested until the immediate ""purchase course materials"" popped up for $40 along with several other ""optional"" purchases that seemed essential. The whole point in starting the trial was the fact it was free. If your faced with obstacles that will not allow you to properly take part in the course unless you make a purchase, why do you advertise it as ""free""? Further more, after reading comments that others have left, I'm wondering if in fact I will be charged anyway.",1,89,2020-12-01 08:05:05,com.shawacademy.app

2706,"Not a great app. I never really got to try the courses. It might be ok, but the pricetag is pretty hefty. The free trial is a joke.

2707,"The app overall is OK, apart from the fact it keeps pushing pop ups about buying something EVERY TIME you go in it. I don't like their business model, they give you a 1 month free trial which is restricted to the first month of classes (the most basic aspects), you can't browse any of the content of the following month.

I had to go through many tabs and keep pressing ""cancel course trial"" more than once. Then after that you can't even cancel.

Secondly, I also find it annoying when they keep trying to get you to buy the toolkit when I keep rejecting the offer. Lastly, when the lesson is completed you are supposed to be able to complete a quiz and turn in your assignment, but they are both locked.

I shouldn't be getting a calculator just to add and divide many individual numbers.

It presents problems, & explanations that only apply to those problems. If you miss assumptions or don't understand concepts, a link in the app is provided to a wiki style knowledge base. It doesn't point you to where you might need to look, you have to search for yourself. In other words, it is EXACTLY the same experience as if you bought a used textbook to pore over.

The problem is, this app shows all sorts of books, and doesn't label the books according to their appropriate age category. I don't see any option for filtering the books according to age, level of difficulty, or level of reading proficiency. So finding an appropriate book to read for my preschooler is a hit and miss. Also, the read to me option is not interactive at all, its like watching a video, not a reading experience. I want my kids to be able to read along, ie they should be able to follow the reader verbatim, and then flip the page at their own pace.

There were some things I'd have liked to see improved, e.g. more grammar, a list of all the content for a course instead of just each module, the ability to make your own modules from the words in the course rather than just flag difficult words, the ability to adjust the speed of the timed questions and time to review the response to your answer before it disappeared. But it was good. The new update is (a) hideous, and (b) broken. The black and yellow theme is awful and subconsciously aversive (like wasps). Some of the content is also now broken: you cannot scroll down the video on my phone to reach the letters you need to answer the question, which was not a problem before, so I just have to skip it!

Putting the tag of free courses, the app asks to pay for some amount so as to avail their certificates of completion or appreciation.
