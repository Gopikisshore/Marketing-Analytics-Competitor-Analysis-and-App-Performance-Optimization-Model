0,This app is the most frustrating app I've ever seen. I dedicated so much time and even sacrifice my sleep to complete a very long course and the app started malfunctioning and my progress wasn't saved. I tried changing password and it could not even change. It is always telling me to log in again and again. Do something quickly because I can't retake the course.

There's a vast amount of courses to choose from, you can search by categories, or keywords.

One other awesome feature is that I can start watching a lecture on PC then go out and resume from where I left off on my phone. That may seem small but when when you have a class full of lectures, it's a must have feature. There are also free classes",5,42,2020-06-03 05:05:03,com.udemy.android

Making that feature pretty much unusable unless you have a basically empty phone as even a 36 min class is over half a gig.  Which is not surprising since HD videos are large files.  Which is why with competently made video apps you can download them to the SD card instead of the device storage.  If you could download the classes to the SD card it would be a 5 star app as the rest works well and is simple to use.,1,4,2019-02-27 23:12:05,com.skillshare.Skillshare

That can be done simply by looking at the date at which the content was created, from books, videos and even blog posts. They all include the date creation info.

It had my account on premium but all the content was locked. I had to uninstall and reinstall for it to work but now it's great.

700,The courses are solid and the app its self smooth and functional. The only reason I'm sticking a star off is both the website and the app lack the ability to cast to my TV like every other streaming program I have.

870,"I recently subscribed to LinkedIn Learning/Lynda and I am very much impressed overall with the service, both on the web version and the mobile versions of the apps. I have been able to find courses on everything I am looking for and there are usually a few instructors for each topic. One might think this is a terrible thing because of potentially repetitive information, but by simply watching the different instructors, you may find someone who makes you feel most comfortable which is most important in any learning experience. This is a fantastic service to support experts who are willing to take the time out to teach and enrich those who are willing to learn. Thank you for the service!",5,39,2018-10-24 16:09:58,com.linkedin.android.learning

It's also very easy to remove the video from the phone to clear up storage. A higher resolution video option would be great. sometime seeing instructor's screens in 720p resolution isn't always the best.,5,65,2020-09-18 10:04:00,com.linkedin.android.learning

What I learned in one course paid for the entire year service! All I do is, I use it to broadcast to my TV through Google Chrome. What I would like, however, if it would be back available on the Roku app as well as there is only a limited version available now, not the full version.

874,Don't want to give full 5 but better than 4. I like it has a lot of tech stuff I want and have added other important life lessons that can help anyone. What I think takes away a full 5 stars is they need to add an attribute to videos if the video can be only listened to as in it does not have nesscary visual information. This way you can search for them. I like to listen when doing other things but pointless when they are explaining how to do something and need to see it.,5,126,2021-08-20 19:02:10,com.linkedin.android.learning

The other half of the time the video will stop playing and start buffering several times in the middle of the video, even if I've fully downloaded the video. I then have to ""go back 10 seconds"" to fix the issue. I have 1 Gb/s Internet speed, so it's definitely not that.

But if you push through too fast, they push back the start date for the next course in the series, ensuring they'll keep getting their money if you want to finish, while keeping you from studying for weeks.

Frequently the subtitles occlude what the teacher writes, and I have no way to turn them off. To get 5 stars, I want the watched/casted videos to consistently check off as ""complete"" in the list of videos when they finish. Right now, they do not, and there is no option to manually set them as ""watched."" Thus, you can lose track of your place, and waste time trying to find it.

So, I thank Coursera for providing the app itself and I appreciate the interface which keeps updating and also, I would like to add the flexibility of the download option within the app which helped me save a lot of data.

1024,I personally loved the platform. But the app has some limitations and it's okay to have that. Coursera courses are really organised. It's been couple of months I'm on it and my experience is excellent. Very well described. And difficulty level increases with intermidiate level and then advanced level courses. It's a really good platform for knowledge and also promotions.,5,15,2022-10-13 02:17:25,org.coursera.android
1025,"Coursera is amazing. I think the write ups could do better in terms of grammatical and spelling errors, but it helps you learn despite where you are starting from in easy and fun ways. I wish they'd shorten their videos more, maybe to 2 minutes each for those struggling with low attention span, it'd be really user effective for us too.

I can't fast forward the video by double tapping anymore. Speeding up the video requires a few steps instead of one like how it was done. The video constantly buffers which almost never happened in the previous version! I hope this 'downgraded' upgrade is temporary and the useful features can be restored.

1050,"New interface is atrocious. Everything was smooth, and easy to understand. Now everything is stretched out too much, and nothing is labeled. They also reduced lesson ""experience"" across the board in their ranked system to encourage people to buy their ""Super"" option (do not, it is not worth it). Probably going to switch to another place to learn if this change is not reverted. It really is impossible to navigate now, and not a user friendly update.",1,315,2022-11-16 11:23:14,com.duolingo
1051,"Not a fan of the new layout at all. This is truly a case of fixing something that wasn't broken. Previously, I could focus on specific topics, jump around, and got a good variety of content. The old interface felt considerably more engaging, while the new single track UI makes the lessons feel more forced. Unfortunate that they couldn't offer both UI options. I'm likely going to look at some of the competing apps at this point.",1,47,2022-11-15 08:05:58,com.duolingo
1052,Ruined by an update. I really enjoyed the sense of control and feedback I got from the old UI. It let me choose what subject to practice and showed specific progress. Now everything looks the same and I have no choice what I practice. I can't focus on areas I know I'm lacking and there's no sense of progress and accomplishment. I made it a goal to get all lessons to level 3 in my unit before starting the next one but now those milestones don't even exist.,1,210,2022-11-15 09:24:53,com.duolingo
1053,I really liked Duo setup. But then they forced a really horrible update. It finished things I hadn't done.

1054,I used to like Duolingo. Then they changed the app format and now it sucks. I wish they'd give you the option to revert back to it. I had made so much progress on it and when they made the switch it erased so much of my progress. I liked that we could go back and do a little review to refresh your memory on units that had already been mastered. I have had the app for about a year and a half. I will be deleting this and find a different app to learn french on that isn't as frustrating.,1,842,2022-11-12 08:57:04,com.duolingo
1055,"The new update with a ""path"" style is an absolute disaster and a horrible interface. You have sections like ""introduce yourself"" but exercises for ordering food. Doesn't make a d☆mn bit of sense. You have to click on each button to see what the heck the lesson is, and some of the buttons don't even do anything. I'm switching to any other app with a better UI.

1056,The app was great until the recent overhaul. They had a nice system that let you review up to 3 lessons that needed practice without using up mistakes and an easy way for someone like me to customize my learning experience. Now it's all streamlined into a one size fits all model that no longer helps me. I've had the app for years but I think it's time to let it go since it isn't helpful for every free user anymore.,1,2,2022-11-17 10:02:23,com.duolingo

1062,It's awful.  1. Their grammar tips were an excellent feature and are now basically gone. You'll have better luck with a verbose 80s grammar book. 2. Going back to review lessons? You can't do that now. Why would they eliminate a helpful feature like that? The ability to review previous lessons is a key feature in language learning....and it makes me think someone is pulling an Elon and destroying the app on purpose. 3. I loved doing this every day.

Now, whatever the next lesson is that we're forced into, it is so broad that we're being taught too many words too infrequently.

There is no substitute for actual conversation in a new language, but Duolingo is a fun and effective way to get the formal ""classroom"" aspects of the language rules and vocabulary. The lessons are well designed, the app has good incentives to keep you motivated. The ads are tolerable to a point.

1173,"Don't bother paying for Plus - offline doesn't work. I am using Duolingo to study Spanish and Korean. I definitely like the Spanish one better because I think there is more content and it has gone through more rounds to make it better for Spanish learners.  However, Plus drives me crazy.  I purchased it so that I could study offline since I study on my commute and a good portion of it is underground with spotty signal.  I can complete the lessons, but it doesn't save my progress.  This results in me having to do the same lessons over again and sometimes, losing my streak (heartbreaking!) I've complained to Duolingo about this and here is the response I got:  ""Our team is aware of this and is working diligently to fix it as quickly as possible. If you're ever in a pinch and you lose your streak because of offline issues, don't hesitate to reach out and we will update your streak right away. In the meantime, I suggest making sure that once you do connect to wifi, that it's a super strong connection. If you're on a weaker connection, it might need some extra time to update.""

1291,I'm presently in class 11 AP state board. And this app is very useful for my chemistry- which I feel as the most difficult. But the problem is that the content in the videos doesn't match the matter in our text books ( mainly physics) . I have to search for the topics which I have as they have other more extra content too. It would be great if you keep the videos of the content we have..... It is the only reason why I've given only 4 stars!!!,4,1143,2021-09-30 20:26:53,haygot.togyah.app
1292,This app is amazing. The concepts are understanding very well.Also easy to remember. But the only disappointment for me is that the video concepts in every lessons are not arranged in order.

ESPECIALLY I get most of the CBSE board related subjects' topics, except of Hindi and English (literature only) it has all other subjects I need (I'm in class 10). Both Hindi and English language is available while taking the pre-recorded classes, in short, this is a 'must try' kind of app! This is an honest review!

Since I study in an ICSE board it is very difficult for me to find any learning app which teaches for free. Toppr provides an option if you want to study for free you can or if you want take the membership and attend live lectures you can do that too. It also provides a selection for all the classes with updated syllabus of that class with test papers and concepts.,5,1032,2022-06-19 13:16:31,haygot.togyah.app

It is always helpful to have one reference book to verify whether everything is being covered. --> the explanation for most of the videos are good but some videos are out of sequence or have bad sound.,5,6,2019-12-17 18:08:41,haygot.togyah.app

1592,"First of all, I must give my gratitude to the Developers of this app. My child loves it and is learning lots from it. And the Super Simple Songs integrated with the games are really great. But the app tends to have some seriously glitchy behaviours. It often shuts off in mid-game and takes the user to the phone home screen. It freezes at that point for some time with a black screen and when trying to getting back into it, it resets the game so my child loses where the game left off. It's a real test of patience at that age. I have had to restart my phone in order to get it to work again sometimes. On another note, certain things that are required to be either clicked or dragged are placed way to close to the top of the screen, which oftentimes causes my child to activate the slide-in menu from the phone during some games. Also a minor thing, when there's a song involved, there are moments where the song is paused in order to begin an interactive game. But the songs are often paused on odd times. It's really not so crucial but it triggers my OCD to some degree. I would suggest to try to tackle that with a little more finesse :) I realize it's in beta but I hope they pay attention to these things when the time comes to launch the real thing.

1623,"It starts a little slow, but give it at least ten lessons before you give up. Also, I realized you can pick whatever lesson you want from the Library icon in the upper left of the home screen. It feels like being in a kids' tv show and getting to answer questions along the way. The animal characters are cute and friendly. I used it for several hours, and it seems completely ad-free, which is great.",5,76,2022-08-10 05:42:24,org.khankids.android
1624,"This app is great, really engaging for my 4 year old preschooler. She loves that she can do it on her own, without any help from me. There's a good mix of activities, songs, and stories, and it goes over so much curriculum like letters, numbers, colors, comparisons, phonics, etc. Really phenomenal for any app, much less a free one. Highly recommend!",5,80,2022-05-25 19:55:05,org.khankids.android
1625,"So far so good. We've only had the app for a few weeks and my three year old is very intrigued. She loves the library section because she likes to pick her own books. She can also navigate the app very well by herself (big plus). No ads (bigger plus), I can safely leave it in her hands. I like the quick learning segments. It is a fun way to learn for a few minutes or longer quiet times.",5,63,2022-06-01 19:34:19,org.khankids.android
1626,"My kids (ages 3 and 5) thoroughly enjoy this app.  The activities are varied enough to keep them interested but repetitive enough to give them a sense of mastery and success.  My 5-year-old can navigate his way through the app without our intervention because of the intuitive interface and helpful audible** prompts.  (**Unfortunately, because my kids still can't read, we can't use this app in situations where the device has to remain very quiet/muted... too often, the non-text-based visual cues/instructions don't sufficiently explain the task at hand.)  It's a valuable resource for our family.  Thanks Khan Academy!!",5,6,2019-03-07 01:48:34,org.khankids.android
1627,"Love this app!! I've spent so much time downloading, trying out, and deleting apps while searching for something appropriate for my toddler to use. I'm impressed and love that it's geared towards learning, as opposed to just mindless play. It has so many different important, and in my opinion, usually untouched (by other apps,) subjects and lessons. It seems that most apps for kids 5 and under only include shapes, colors, or letters and numbers, which is nice, but my child has those mastered already, so I was thrilled to see the range of learning topics covered. Between the content, the lack of ads, easy navigation, I'd say Great job! Keep it up! I'll definitely be recommending this app!",5,2,2018-10-03 12:55:55,org.khankids.android
1628,"I love Khan Academy and their mission of free, quality education. As a frequent user of it over the years, I was excited, but hesitant to see their app for children. Most other education apps geared toward children are filled with ads or are limited/extremely basic unless you pay. Khan Academy contains none of that. It's filled with fun, interesting games that are age appropriate. My daughter loves the songs and activities. I like that you can select different levels based on their age, and it's easy enough for her to navigate (she's two, almost three) while my hands are busy doing her hair. Thank you, Khan Academy!",5,18,2018-11-27 19:50:21,org.khankids.android
1629,My daughter's almost 18 months but she's obsessed with phones and she will hand them to us when the screen is off to turn it back on. All I really wanted for now was an app she could use where I wouldn't have to worry about her sending messages/changing settings etc. but I figured I'd try to also find one she could actually use properly once she's a bit older.  I tried a few of the most popular ones and wasn't too impressed. The Khan one is so much better and she's clearly already learning from it and trying really hard to understand what's going on to use it properly. I don't think it will be long before that happens.  I love the wide range of different content on there and it all feels like useful stuff for her to learn about. The music and voices and animations are all great and not annoying like many kids' things can be. We will be getting her a tablet for her 2nd birthday and this is probably the only app it'll have on it.,5,8,2019-05-23 20:49:31,org.khankids.android
1630,"I downloaded this for my 2 and 4 year olds. They love it! There is so much variety and I never have to buy a new pack of something or tell my kids they can only play on certain unlocked parts because it's all free! My kids love being able to switch between listening to books, watching videos, and playing games. I love that it's all educational, can be tailored to each child's age/level, and that you can link the account to different devices by via login and they can be at the same spot on all devices! Great app!",5,14,2018-10-24 18:24:08,org.khankids.android
1631,"Familiar with Kahn academy in my own schooling, I had an expected a high caliber of effort and effectiveness and overall quality. This app exceeded my expectations. My daughter(2) gets lost in the songs and books. She has learned multiple tunes and words while I do the dishes, drive the car, or shop for dinner. Obviously it isn't a replacement for working with your kiddo but it's MUCH better than the apps that trick her into buying things or letting her run wild in the matrix of YouTube. The only problem I've experienced: sometimes the loading screen gets stuck for minutes. Being in Beta this is highly understandable. She brings it to me and I close the app and she restarts. Overall an amazing app. I'm eagerly anticipating each update and highly appreciative of the most recent one :)",5,13,2018-12-12 20:04:22,org.khankids.android
1632,"My 3 year old daughter and I both love this app. It has adorable characters, just the right mix of songs/games/interactive features, great learning content, and it lets the kid choose a game over and over again, which is what kids at this age love to do :)   My only complaint is with switching to other apps. I don't see the home/back/menu buttons while in the app (I use a Huawei Honor 7x), so I have to press the power button to get out of the app. And when I switch back, the app restarts, not allowing the kid to continue what she was playing.",5,13,2019-03-13 20:23:46,org.khankids.android
1633,"Great educational app. Started with my 2 year old. The content is advancing as he is learning more and is able to do more.  I love how it teaches more than just letters/reading and math - it teaches about weather and feelings, and even more. We are able to incorporate things from the app into our discussions of every day life, which helps him make connections more easily. And no ads or paid stuff! Perfect for a little kid who likes to tap everything to see what happens!",5,5,2019-03-07 02:29:14,org.khankids.android
1634,"I am so grateful for this app. My two year old daughter loves it. She is speech delayed and loves to learn and this is my favorite app for her. The only issue I have is the tapping and dragging feature is a bit difficult for her at with her age & capabilities. She taps the screen several times and it won't work and by the time it registers she's tapping again and it's undoing it and saying ""uh-oh"" so she is thinking she chose wrong. This gets her frustrated so we end up moving to another lesson.",5,8,2019-05-24 13:54:52,org.khankids.android

1950,"I don't just have an issue with the app but the whole upgrad platform. They make serious errors for which you have to pay the price. They incorrectly added previously completed modules to your lessons , they erase the progress you made in a course forcing you to retake the lessons. Half the time you spend writing and talking to them to resolve your issues. All in all a painful experience.

It does not allow for screen rotation, so video presentation is limited to whatever the width (not length) of your screen is. It has an option for audio only, so you can cut back cell data usage while you're just listening. While using cell data, it also unexpectedly pauses, skips, and decides that you're done with a lecture while there are still several minutes to go. I haven't noticed this with WiFi data, but also haven't given it a thorough testing. Probably the second-most annoying part is that the app wants to launch every time I unlock my phone. I have absolutely no idea why. TL;DR? Sure you're going to be able to get your Great Courses stuff. Aside from that, it needs a lot of work.

Any touch of the screen meant to get the buttons to show again may make you lose your progress on the lecture, and that's about as disruptive as it gets for this kind of app.",2,21,2019-06-05 11:09:52,com.tgc.greatcoursesplus

Now the new version, I'll admit, is certainly more aesthetically appealing. Being able to collapse different course titles in the ""Downloads"" view is helpful, and I like having quick access to the PDF course guides. However, this version also took a few steps backwards: 1) Why can't we store videos on SD card anymore? Will TGC bring that back or has it been permanently removed? The videos take up a LOT of space and I was running low as it was. 2) Now all videos play with the status bar and button bar permanently visible instead of in full-screen view. Could you please at least provide a setting so users can choose whether they want full-screen or non-full-screen playback? 3) Whenever I'm downloading a video for offline playback all the images on the screen start flashing.

2313,"2020-04-16 (revised to 3 stars) The folks at Great Courses Plus are obviously working on improving the user experience and have made a significant progress over the past 2 weeks. The latest version of the app (version 5.2) times out less frequently and hasn't crashed on me yet. Therefore, the original 1 star review is no longer warranted. There is still room for improvement, but kudos to TGC for the progress so far. 2020-04-04 (original review) The 1-star review is for the new release of the Android app and the lack of support for it. First general problems: The app hangs, crashes, and will go into spinner mode until you exit and restart it. This happens multiple times daily. And when it's not doing those things, it can be painfully slow. I suspect much of the slowness is due to a new back-end system implemented by the Great Courses. Things have gotten substantially worse after the upgrade to the new system (when all of the device passwords were reset). Specific bugs: 1) Speaking of passwords, the Android app has a 20 character limit for the password, even though the website will allow you to configure a longer password. There's no warning about this website. I had to figure it out the hard way. 2) The app allows you to download content so you don't have to stream and incur data plan charges. But inexplicably (I think because they never tested this), when you start to play downloaded content while not connected to wi-fi, you get a pop-up warning you that you need to change settings to allow data streaming because you're not connected to wi-fi. But this is the whole point of downloading content. And if you try to exit popup, you have either changed the setting (which I don't want to do - I downloaded the content because I *don't* want to stream over my data plan) or you haven't changed it and playback stops. So I just leave the dialog open and then app eventually crashes once I'm back in wi-fi range. Great... I haven't received a response to any of my recent attempts to contact Customer Service. As a long-time customer of The Teaching Company / The Great Courses (since the time when courses were sent out on cassette tapes) this is disappointing. They used to have very good, responsive customer service. It's a shame because the app and customer service are so bad that I'm ready to cancel.",3,39,2020-04-17 09:12:53,com.tgc.greatcoursesplus
2314,"The app loses all my information llike Favorites or Downloads when it remains dormant for a period of time. I have to kill the app and restart it and it then remembers everything.

If there is a setting somewhere else, it's buried and therefore useless to me. The immediacy of the video player language selection makes much more sense. Another UX improvement IMO would that when a video is playing (or casting) and you click on the app thumbnail from the desktop, that the app opens on the course that is playing, and the video that is playing is selected, with the video scrubber displayed.

2623,There are many problems. (1) The teachers explain either in Hindi or Hinglish even if I choose for English they teaches in Hinglish. Many non Hindi speakers will face difficulty with that. Many non Hindi speakers mayn't understand such Hindi words they use. (2) It takes a lot of time to solve doubts. It takes more than 15 minutes to solve a one word question.,3,1,2022-06-29 09:45:30,com.vedantu.app

After I missed the first quarter of the lesson. Not a good first impression. And the only support option I saw was an ai bot. Oh and God forbid you get a phone call during the session. Plus it says the recording is now available since I missed most of it due to technical issues, but of course it's not. Unbelievable.",1,12,2019-09-05 20:22:27,com.shawacademy.app
2701,Not only do you pay a monthly subscription fee but you pay for class materials as well it is quite a racket they have going. On top of that you are inundated with messages through email and text about EVERYTHING!!!! I easily got at 6 - 7 emails and another 6 -7 texts each and every single day. Plus the app set notifications as well. The information in the classes were just not worth the hassle.,1,7,2020-09-04 02:22:18,com.shawacademy.app
2702,"More of a hassle. I was interested in some of the course options. I signed up for the free 4 week trial. I attempted to cancel 3 days into the free trial, it took a survey, multiple questions, and still was directed to call in. Two months later I was charged $69.99 for a service I thought was canceled and never accessed the content. And still am being pushed around about getting my refund.",1,0,2020-12-04 20:08:01,com.shawacademy.app
2703,"Very misleading. Was very interested until the immediate ""purchase course materials"" popped up for $40 along with several other ""optional"" purchases that seemed essential. The whole point in starting the trial was the fact it was free. If your faced with obstacles that will not allow you to properly take part in the course unless you make a purchase, why do you advertise it as ""free""? Further more, after reading comments that others have left, I'm wondering if in fact I will be charged anyway.",1,89,2020-12-01 08:05:05,com.shawacademy.app
2704,"Attempted several times to cancel subscription before I was charged seeing that the platform isn't as helpful as it could be.

2705,I definitely give a 5 star rating for the courses as they are very detailed informative and helping with my personal growth as well as my lone of work. It's the ongoing system issues that is driving me up the wall. The app is not working for me all I get is a blank scene with a blue circle loading in the middle of the screen but nothing loads just keeps spinning. Some courses I should have completed already but all I get is coming soon the entire module 4.,1,7,2021-04-03 18:24:16,com.shawacademy.app
2706,"Not a great app. I never really got to try the courses. It might be ok, but the pricetag is pretty hefty. The free trial is a joke. No one should have to go through four prompts with the option to continue to cancel subscription being grayed out until they ultimately have to call a number to cancel. Not to mention you can only call during business hours even though it's an automated process",1,28,2021-05-24 19:43:08,com.shawacademy.app
2707,"The app overall is OK, apart from the fact it keeps pushing pop ups about buying something EVERY TIME you go in it. I don't like their business model, they give you a 1 month free trial which is restricted to the first month of classes (the most basic aspects), you can't browse any of the content of the following month. You also can't start classes right away and you have to schedule all of them, instead of giving you the option to watch them on demand.",1,4,2020-06-24 23:35:29,com.shawacademy.app
2708,"They promoted a course for free so I made an account. What they don't tell you is they take 50 cents from you and that you have to pay for tools for the free course. But you don't find that out until afterwards of course. I tried to cancel and their customer service is as bad as Sprint. I had to go through many tabs and keep pressing ""cancel course trial"" more than once. Then after that you can't even cancel.

When I eventually did manage to cancel it, they then took 3 separate payments 2 months later for something I'm still trying to figure out what for and they won't refund me.

Not only that they still charged me even after I did, they said it hadn't gone through on their end, and I'm still being charged one month later. I've had to make a claim with my bank because ""they dont do refund"". Instead I'm being offered a one year package valued at about $800. Wow! Shows the value of the courses when they cant refund $70.",1,106,2020-06-05 21:56:43,com.shawacademy.app
2711,"Worst courses ever. Not live, even though they say they are. It told me I missed one even though I'd watched it. No replay button if you miss one. You to reschedule since they're ""live"" The courses aren't fully available without having to purchase pieces as you go- things like study guides and quizes! Even though I tried to cancel, it still charged me, and I still don't even have access to the full course. Complete RIP off and waste of time.

2712,"It just sucks. The issues are many. 1. The app doesn't sync well. At all. Adding a class to your schedule doesn't show up on your learning plan. It does however, register on the back end. This is evident because they send notifications about your next class. Which is my next issue. 2. Intrusive notification. You will get reminders at 12am or later in the evening reminding you about your class. Clicking the link opens up a web browser instead of the app. The link is functional, but innacurate.",1,24,2020-08-08 00:01:06,com.shawacademy.app
2713,"[Update: finally successfully canceled. Except now I'm getting spam texts too.] More like a scam than a school. To cancel my free trial, you have to call in with a member ID, that is not in the app, only the webpage. It's an automated system but you still have to call at certain hours. I've canceled twice in 3 days and still get emails. My account still says I'm subscribed. Trying to view help page in app says page doesn't exist. When calling it assumes I'm someone else.",1,6,2021-05-13 23:27:01,com.shawacademy.app

Secondly, I also find it annoying when they keep trying to get you to buy the toolkit when I keep rejecting the offer. Lastly, when the lesson is completed you are supposed to be able to complete a quiz and turn in your assignment, but they are both locked. From my understanding, the lessons should take an hour, mainly 30 minutes of information and the other should be spent completing the assignments.

It made the site/app hard to navigate on your phone because it took up a decent size of the screen and never seemed to go away even after hitting the X button. That being said, I stuck with it because the content was great and the instructors were very knowledgable and easy to follow.",4,3,2020-07-19 17:38:30,com.shawacademy.app

2794,"Promising app! Content is organized, relevant, nicely presented, and detailed. Room for improvement: Navigation is cumbersome at first, not quite intuitive. There are editing errors in the quizzes and assignments. The plethora of emails, texts, and app notifications is enough to stress a person out. Many could be combined into just one. I am really excited to see this app grow and expand.

2795,"App is pretty useful as you can attend classes/videos from your phone, although changing class times and your schedule could be made easier as I have run into some technical issues of changing the class schedule times. Also I wish I didn't receive a million notifications and emails and text all the time trying to sell me stuff or updates- it is a bit of overkill. 'Ad blindness' comes to mind, a term I recently learned while doing the Digital Marketing course on here... As for the content- I have only completed my first week of classes for two courses I am doing. So far it has been decently informative and helpful, although sometimes the classes come off more as recordings than interactive courses. Also for one of my classes I had a different 'instructor' on the second lesson and I would of liked to keep the one I had in the first lesson to have some consistency. Otherwise I am thrilled to start learning on these courses. I am curious to see if they will compare better to other online courses as there are many many options out there.",4,1,2020-07-03 04:30:58,com.shawacademy.app
2796,"This app seems to function well for the purposes. The courses themselves are still being explored but seem to provide good information thus far.

Especially since I signed up for 4 concurrent classes. These could be consolidated into a daily single message? I would also like to view 2 classes in a row on the same day but have to jump through the scheduling hoops to make that happen. The music classes are like that.

3192,This is great app. This helps all the students for learning. I like this app most. But I suggest one thing that is there should be an option for control playback speed. That helps the students a lot while watching the recorded sessions. Thats why I gave it 4 stars. Because so many students are watched the recorded sessions. And playback speed helps that students to save their valuable time. All other features of the app is great.😊,5,981,2022-03-31 15:29:22,com.noonEdu.k12App

It presents problems, & explanations that only apply to those problems. If you miss assumptions or don't understand concepts, a link in the app is provided to a wiki style knowledge base. It doesn't point you to where you might need to look, you have to search for yourself. In other words, it is EXACTLY the same experience as if you bought a used textbook to pore over.

Perhaps if I were relying on this as a primary education method I would pay the subscription, but for an entrant such as myself, this is perfect. Update: I am now using Sololearn to prepare for a coding bootcamp, and have subscribed to the service. It has been very helpful so far, and (compared to the bootcamp) the subscription is very affordable. Has bumped up a 4 to a 5 star.",5,13,2022-07-18 21:38:41,com.sololearn

It organizes the lessons in a sensible way, and where most textbooks would make the lessons overwhelming to look at, this app breaks everything into pieces and makes it easy as possible to learn.

This app makes me feel more motivated to continue onto the next set of studying because each block is relatively short (approx 3-5 questions per) and you can see the next blocks that you have left. It doesn't feel overwhelming or make you feel like you're not getting anywhere. That's what I think this app has over the other ones.

There are a few shortcomings: certain lessons such as the algorithm lesson are incomplete, that is to say, they don't present concrete examples of how to implement the algorithms which left me fairly confused. There also seems to be a stigma that beginners are capable of creating somewhat complicated programs such as the challenge to turn a string of a date into a date that references a day of the week. Even with all the formal lessons and Solo Learn lessons, so still can't figure out that one.

3882,I'm going to split my review into two parts: Epic's content: We originally got Epic through school. We have access to 6 different services for our kids to read. Of all of them Epic is the best so we decided to subscribe. It's easy to use and the kids are actually excited to read on Epic. The Android app: It works fine but is missing some key features. No way to download books or audio books for offline usage in the car. Also when playing an audiobook you can't use the phone for navigation.,3,100,2020-08-31 22:43:46,com.getepic.Epic

But since he can no longer turn off the screen, he hates using it. The book selection is great but for $8 a month I should still be able to turn off my screen.

The app uses your 2 hours of after school time even though it says you have switched over to school time and then doesn't work for the week. Now it's not recording what books we have already read. Great concept, but needs a bit of work.",3,179,2021-01-05 00:24:57,com.getepic.Epic

3886,"I wish this app would work for us, I installed it for my kids 3 year old and 5 year old. Both are learning to read, and could not read on their own yet. The problem is, this app shows all sorts of books, and doesn't label the books according to their appropriate age category. I don't see any option for filtering the books according to age, level of difficulty, or level of reading proficiency. So finding an appropriate book to read for my preschooler is a hit and miss. Also, the read to me option is not interactive at all, its like watching a video, not a reading experience. I want my kids to be able to read along, ie they should be able to follow the reader verbatim, and then flip the page at their own pace. I guess this app is not so suitable for early readers (pre-K or grade K).",3,13,2020-10-27 18:42:50,com.getepic.Epic

No way to select only books in their reading level which means they have a hard time a accessing books they can actually read. At least this is our experience and we are new to the app/sight.

I used to really like Memrise as a handy and fun learning toll to keep my brain active by learning some Japanese and Spanish. It looked nice and I liked the space theme and calming blue colours. There were some things I'd have liked to see improved, e.g. more grammar, a list of all the content for a course instead of just each module, the ability to make your own modules from the words in the course rather than just flag difficult words, the ability to adjust the speed of the timed questions and time to review the response to your answer before it disappeared. But it was good. The new update is (a) hideous, and (b) broken. The black and yellow theme is awful and subconsciously aversive (like wasps). Some of the content is also now broken: you cannot scroll down the video on my phone to reach the letters you need to answer the question, which was not a problem before, so I just have to skip it!

4098,"Amazing way to learn Portuguese. I've been with this app for YEARS. They get better every year and I'm thrilled about the new content that has been added. I love that you can hear locals, practice pronunciation (and can listen to yourself back) as well work on listening and associating words. I hope they add grammar, but if not it's okay. This jam packs a lot to just move forward to speak with and communicate with natives.",5,12,2022-08-10 05:57:23,com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion
4099,"I recently started the European Portuguese course and am enjoying it. I especially appreciate the videos of native speakers, as they don't always speak with the same clarity as the stylized, perfectly accented audio clips. The listening practice clips took a bit to get the hang of, with one actor playing all the parts, but that forces you to really focus on the dialogue and not rely too much on visual cues for context.",5,38,2022-08-01 19:35:47,com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion
4100,"I love Memrise. Duolingo is fine, but it's a bit more obnoxious. For example, after you choose the answer, you push the button to check, then you have to push another button to continue, even though you can't stop at that time anyway. It just throws me off and interrupts my rhythm. Memrise is more helpful to me with the efficiency of learning, the short bursts of lessons that I can do at my leisure and the memes, since I am very visual. It's less condescending to me, and more fun. 💗👍",5,206,2022-06-12 09:04:29,com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion
4101,"I like this app. I think it's a great addition to my daily study routine. I like that it has real people speaking in the video clips as opposed to the generated voices of other apps. I mimic the video each time, so I can get some good shadowing exercises in. I hope that it improves my accent when speaking to natives. I also like the spacing in repetition of vocabulary.",5,20,2022-07-18 05:13:45,com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion
4102,"Just getting started learning (European) Portuguese with Memrise. Hearing native speakers say phrases I'm learning has really helped. Moreover, they do not use the same inflection so you can get a better real life sense of the words and phrases as they are being used. Another helpful feature is the ability to mark words as difficult so you can see them more often. You can also add notes to help you remember them. Overall, my experience has been enjoyable and I'm excited to learn!",5,67,2022-07-11 21:57:01,com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion
4103,"The best app for learning a language. I haven't used it in a while and wanted to get back into it. The prices are much cheaper than when I originally signed up which was the reason I came back here and didn't sub to another, and that's excluding the deal.
